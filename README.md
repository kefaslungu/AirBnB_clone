#hello!
## 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## Introduction
This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project for ALX  Software Engineering: aug 2022, to jul 2023.
In this case, we need to create the console that will be used for testing and managing objects of our project.

## How to start the console
For you to start the console, you can do it on an interactive mode using ```./console.py``` or on an non-interactive mode using ```echo "command" | ./console.py```(where command is the command that will be passed)

##For example:

### Interactive form
``` shell
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
### Non-interactive form
``` shell
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
